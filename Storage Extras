#AWS Snow Family
Data migration: snowcone snowballedge  snowmobile
Edge computing: snow snowball edge

We setup snowball edge/ snowcone device to do edge computing

Snowball edge – compute optimized 
52vCPU, 208 GiB or RAM
Optional GPU

Snowball cannot import to Glacier directly
Must use Amazon S3 first , in combination with an S3 lifecycle policy

#AWS storage Gateway
3 types of storage gateway:
File gateway：Integrated with active directory for user authentication

Volume gateway:
Cached volumes：low latency access to most recent data
Stored volumes: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3
Tape gateway

!#On-premises data to the cloud – storage gateway
File access /NFS – user auth with active directory -file gateway(backed by S3)
Volumes/block storage .iSCSI (tap gateway) –volume gateway(backed by s3 with ebs snapshot)
No on-premises visualization –hardware 

#Amazon Fsx
a.	For Windows: (file server)
Support SMB protocol & Windows NTFS
b.	For Lustre : high performance computing (HPC)

#Amazon file system deployment options:
a.	Scratch file system:
Temporary storage / data is not replicated / high burst / short term processing, optimize costs
b.	Persistent file system:
Long-term storage
Data is replicated within same AZ
Replace failed files within minutes
Long-term, sentitive data
