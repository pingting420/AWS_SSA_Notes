#RDS – Storge Auto Scaling
Increase storage 
It scales automatically
Avoid manually scaling your database storage

#Understand difference between RDS Read Replicas and Multi AZ
*Up to 5 Read Replicas
*Within AZ, Cross AZ or cross region
*Replication in ASUNC so read are eventually consistent 
Read replicate if only for reads

Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)
Increase availability
Noy used for scaling

The Read Replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery

#RDS Security – Encryption
If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted.
To enforce SSL:
PostgreSQL
MySQL

#RDS Security – Network & IAM
IAM can help control who can manage AWS RDS

IAM database wuthentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL
Don’t need a password, just an authentication token obtained hrough IAM&RDS &API calss

#Amazon Aurora
One reader and multi writes


ElastiCache and RDS Read Replicas do indeed help with scaling reads.
Storing Session Data in ElastiCache is a common pattern to ensuring different instances can retrieve your user's state if needed.
