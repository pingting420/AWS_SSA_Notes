#EBS – Elastic Block Store
EBS Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
They can only be mounted to one instance at a time
Bound to a specific availability zone
Like a “network USB stick”
a.	It’s a network drive
b.	Locked to an availability zone
c.	Have a provisioned capacity

*EBS – Delete on Termination attribute
By default, the root EBS volume is deleted.
By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted
This can be controlled by AWS console/ AWS CLI
USE CASE: preserve root volume when instance is terminated, to save some data, you can disable delete on termination for the root volume.

#EBS Snapshots:backup

#AMI
Amazon Machine Image: are a customization of an EC2 instance / built for a specific region 

#EC2 Instance Store
EBS network drives
EC2 need a high- performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they’re stopped
Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content
Risk of data loss if hardware fails

#EBS Volume types：
a.	*gp2 / gp3
General Purpose SSD
Cost effective storage, low latency
only gp2 / gp3 and io1 / io2 can be used as boot volumes
gp3 can independent set up IOPs and for gp2, they are linked together
b.	io1 / io2
IO2 has more durability and more IOPS per GiB
c.	st1(HDD)
d.	sc1(HDD)Hard Disk Drives
Provisioned IOPS(PIOPS)SSD

#EBS Multi-Attach –only if io 1 /io 2 family
Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instance in the same AZ
Use case:
Achieve higher application availability

#EBS Encryption
Leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
How to encrypt an unencrypted EBS volume?

#EBS RAID Options
RAID 0 – increase performance
RAID 1 – increase fault tolerance
RAID 5(not recommended)
RAID 6 (not recommended)

#EFS – Elastic File System
Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC@
Highly available, scalable, expensive, pay per use
*!Compatible with Linux based AMI ( not Windows)

#EFS –performance &storage Classes
Performance mode(set at EFS creation time)
a.	 General purpose: latency-sensitive (web server, CMS)
b.	Max I/O – high latency, throughput, highly parallel(big data, processing)

Throughput mode:
If have small size file, need very high throughput, need move into provision throughput mode for EFS.
Storage Tiers:
Standard : for frequently accessed files
Infrequent access: cost to retrieve files, lower price to stores
