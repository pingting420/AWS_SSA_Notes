#Amazon EC2

EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
Consists in the capability of:
a.	Renting virtual machines (EC2)
b.	Storing data on virtual drives ( EBS)
c.	Distributing load across machines (ELB)
d.	Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

# EC2 User data
Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
That script is only run once at the instance first start
*EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
Installing updates
Installing software 
Downloading common files from the Internet

# EC2 Instance types Basics:
a.	General Purpose
Balance between:
Compute
Memory
Networking
b.	Compute Optimized: Great for intensive tasks require high performance process
c.	Memory Optimized: large date sets in memory
d.	Accelerated Computing
e.	Storage Optimized: require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
f.	Instance Features
g.	Measuring Instance Performance

# Different Instance types has different families, AWS has the following naming convention:
M5.2xlarge
M: instance
5: generation ( AWS improves them over time)
2xlarge: size within the instance class

# Security Groups
Security groups  only contain allow rules
Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group 
Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instance
They regulate:
a.	Access to Ports
b.	Authorized Ip ranges – Ipv4 and IPv6
c.	Control of inbound network
d.	Control of outbound network

#* Security Groups 
a.	Can be attach to multiple instances
b.	Locked down to a region / VPC combination
c.	Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
d.	It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
e.	All inbound traffic is blocked by default
f.	All outbound traffic is authorized by default

# Classic Ports to know:
a.	22 = SSH ( Secure Shell) – log into a Linus instance
b.	21 = FTP ( File transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
c.	22 = SFTP ( Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
d.	80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
e.	443 = HTTPs – access secured website
f.	3389 = RDP ( Remote Desktop Protocol) 

# SSH is one of the most important function It allows you to control a remote machine , all using the command line.
Question: Permissions : 0644 for XXX are too open.
Answer: chmod 0400
SSH connect to the machine

# Two way connect to instance:
EC2 instance connect 
SSH client

As a rule of thumb, never enter your IAM APA key ect into a EC2 Instance
Instead to do is use IAM rules.

IAM role connect with EC2 // Only through IAM roles
!**Use IAM roles for your EC2 Instance

#EC2  Instance Purchasing Options:
a.	On Demand Instance: On-demand Instances are good for short workloads with predictable pricing.
1)	Pay for what you use:
Linus – billing per second
All other operating systems – billing per hour
2)	Has highest cost
3)	No long-term commitment
4)	Recommend for short-term and un-interrupted workloads

b.	Reserved Instance: Reserved Instances are good for long workloads. You can reserve instances for 1 or 3 years.
1)	Up to 75% discount compared to On-demand
2)	Reservation period : 1 year =+ discount\ 3 year
3)	Purchasing options 
4)	Reserve a specific instance type
c.	Spot Instance
1)	Get a discount of up to 90%
2)	You can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current sopt price
3)	The MOST cost- efficient instances in AWS
4)	Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure:
Batch jobs/ data analysis/ image processing / any distributed workloads
5)	Not suitable for critical job or database
d.	Dedicated Hosts: can help you address compliance requirements and reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.
1)	More expensive
e.	Dedicated Instance
1)	Running on hardware that’s dedicated to you
2)	May share hardware with other instances in same account
3)	No control over instance placement
