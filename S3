#S3 Encryption
a.	SSE – S3 
b.	SSE- KMS
c.	SSE – C – Must needs HTTP
d.	Client Side Encryption

HTTP is mandatory for SSE-C
Encryption in flight is also called SSL/TLS

#S3 Security
Used Based
IAM Identity and Access Management
Resource Based
Bucket Policies

Bucket settings for block public access
These setting were created to prevent company data leaks

User Security:
MFA Delete: can be required in versioned buckets to delete objetcs
Pre-Signed URLs: valid only for limited time

#S3 CORES
If a client does a cross-origin request on our S3 bucket, we need to enable the crrect CORES headers

S3 MFA Delete – Multi- Factor Authentication 
*Only the bucket owner can enable/disable MFA-Delete
Need MFA only to permanently delete

#S3 Access Logs

ACL -Access Control List
#S3 Replication ( CRR &SRR) Cross Region Replication / Same Region Replication
CRR: Compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts

#S3 Pre-signed URLs

Amazon Glacier
Low cost object storage meant for archiving/ backup
Data is retained for the longer term

Each item in Glacier is called “Archive”
Archives are stored in “Vaults”

Amazon Glacier & Glacier Deep Archive
Amazon Glacier:
Expedited( 1 to 5 minutes)
Standard(3 to 5 hours)
Bulk(5 to 12 hours)
Minimum storage duration of 90 days

Amazon Glacier Deep Archive- for long term storage -cheaper
Standard ( 12hours)
Bulk(48hours)

S3—Moving between storage classes
For infrequently accessed object, move them to STANDARD_IA
For archive objects , you don’t need in real-time, GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE

STANDARD_IA
INTELLIGENT-TIERING
ONEZONE_IA

Lifecycle rule:
1.	Transition
2.	Expire
3.	Permanently delete
4.	Delete expired delete markers 

#S3 Analytics -Storage Class Analysis
Good first step to put together Lifecycle Rules(or improve them)

#S3 Performance
There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket

#S3 – KMS Limitation
If you use SSE-KMS, you may be impacted by the KMS limits
When you upload, it calls the GenerateDataKey KMS API
Download, it calls Decrypt KMS API

#How to update S3 Performance
a.	Multi -Part upload:
Files>100MB, files>5G
Can help parallelize uploads(speed up transfers)
b.	S3 Transfer Acceleration
Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location

S3 Performance – S3 Byte-Range Fetches
Can be used speed up download
Can be used to retrieve only partial fata

#S3 Select & Glacier Select
Filtering of data server-side in S3 to get less, think about S3 Select English or select.
#S3 Event Notifications
SNS 
SQS 
Lambda Function

#S3- Requester Pays

#AWS Athena
