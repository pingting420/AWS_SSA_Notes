CloudFront vs S3 Region Replication
CF: Global Edge network
Files are cached for a TTL
Great for static content that must be available everywhere

S3: 
must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
Files are updated in near real-time
Read only
Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions


CloudFront Signed URL

Signed URL = access to individual files
Signed Cookies = access to multiple files

#CloudFront Signed URL vs S3 Pre-Signed URL
