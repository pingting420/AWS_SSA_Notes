# High Availability & Scalability for EC2
Vertical Scaling
Horizontal Scaling
High availability

#Load balancer
Is a managed load balancer
LBs can scale but not instantaneously – contact AWS for “warm-up”
Troubleshooting:
4xx errors are client induced errors
5xx errors are application induced errors
LB errors 503 means at capacity or no registered target
If the LB can’t connect to your application , check your security groups

#Classic Load Balancers(vl)
Supports TCP (Layer4) ,HTTP & HTTPS (Layer7)
Health checks are TCP or HTTP based

#Application Load Balancer(V2)

#Network Load Balancer(V2) – NLB 
a.	Network load balancers(Lyers) allow to :
Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instance
Handle millions of request per seconds
Less latency ~ 100ms
b.	NLB has one static IP per AZ and supports assigning Elastic IP

# Load Balancer--- Stickiness
#Load Balancer – Cross-Zone Load Balancing
a.	Application Load Balancer
Always on (can’t disabled)
No charges for inter AZ data
b.	Network Load Balancer
Disabled by default
You pay charges for inter AZ data if enabled
c.	Classic Load Balancer
Through Console = Enabled by default
Through CLI / API = Disabled by default
No charges for inter AZ data if enabled

#SSL and TLS certificate – Basics
SSL allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit
It have an expiration data and must be renewed .

# SSL—Server Name Indication
Only works for ALB&NLB, CloudFront
Does not work for CLB
Elastic Load Balancers – SSL Certificates
Classic Load Balancer( v1)
Support only one SSL certificate
Must use multiple CLB for multiple hostname with multiple SSL certificate

Application Load Balancer (V2)
Multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
Uses SNI make it work

Network Load Balancer (v2)
 Multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
Uses SNI make it work

*！ELB – Connection Draining

*Auto Scaling Group--ASG
If instance get terminated for whatever reason, the ASG will automativally create new ones as a replacement.

*Auto Scaling Group—Scaling Policies

*Auto Scaling Group – Scaling Cooldowns

*ASG for Solutions Architect
Launch Template vs Launch Configuration

Launch Template: Must be re-created every time
Launch Configuration:
Can have multiple versions
Create parameters subsets
Provision using both On-Demand and Spot instance
Recommended by AWS going forward
Can use T2 unlimited burst feature

Which scaling policy should you use?



Exam：
Load Balancers provide a Static DNS name we can use in our application
NLB provide the highest performance if your application needs it
Use a NLB (Network Load Balancer) support TCP instead
The capacity of your ASG cannot go over the maximum capacity you have allocated during scale out events
Network Load Balancers expose a public static IP, whereas an Application or Classic Load Balancer exposes a static DNS (URL)
This is the most secure way of ensuring only the ALB can access the EC2 instances. Referencing by security groups in rules is an extremely powerful rule and many questions at the exam rely on it. Make sure you fully master the concepts behind it!
SNI (Server Name Indication) is a feature allowing you to expose multiple SSL certs if the client supports it. Read more here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-sni/
